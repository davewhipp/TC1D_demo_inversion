    "# Introduction to T<sub>c</sub>1D (Inverse mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter notebook, an interactive web application that can be used to run numerical simulations. In this notebook we will explore using the T<sub>c</sub>1D software in inverse mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inversion of Thermochronological Data with T<sub>c</sub>1D\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermochronology provides quantitative constraints on the cooling history of rocks through geological time. These data are used to infer the timing and rate of processes such as exhumation and burial. However, the relationship between the geological parameters (e.g., erosion history) and the observed thermochronological ages is complex and non-linear. Therefore, you need to solve an inverse problem: What are the ranges of model parameters (e.g., erosion rate, timing of erosion, etc.) that best reproduce the observed data?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Inversion?\n",
    "\n",
    "An inversion explores possible model parameters and selects those that, when used in forward simulations, generate synthetic data consistent with the observations. In practice, we compare observed and predicted thermochronological ages to quantify the model misfit. Inverse problems are often non-unique and can present multiple acceptable solutions, which is why we must explore the parameter space systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inversion Methods in T<sub>c</sub>1D\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates two popular approaches for exploring the parameter space and performing inversions with the T<sub>c</sub>1D software:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Neighbourhood Algorithm (NA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A stochastic, adaptive sampling method.\n",
    "- It iteratively explores the parameter space by favoring regions of lower misfit.\n",
    "- It efficiently identifies acceptable models and only approximates the posterior probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Bayesian, probabilistic method based on random walks.\n",
    "- It samples the parameter space proportionally to the likelihood of each model.\n",
    "- It allows full statistical characterization of the uncertainties but is often computationally more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use T<sub>c</sub>1D to perform both NA and MCMC inversions on a simple dataset. The goal is to illustrate how these methods work and how to visualize and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️**\n",
    "\n",
    "The inversions performed in this notebook are simplified and use a limited number of parameters, reduced model complexity, and small sampling sizes. This is done intentionally to ensure rapid execution and allow interactive exploration within a Jupyter notebook environment. The results shown here are purely illustrative and do not represent a scientifically valid interpretation of real thermochronological datasets. For rigorous scientific applications, inversions should be performed with appropriately complex models, realistic parameter ranges, and sufficient sampling to ensure robust exploration of the parameter space.\n",

    "- `--ero-option1`: exhumation magnitude *m₁* (km) for the first phase\n",
    "- `--ero-option2`: transition time *t₁* (Myr) at which erosion rate changes\n",
    "- `--ero-option3`: exhumation magnitude *m₂* (km) for the second phase\n",
    "- `--ero-option4`: (optional) second transition time *t₂* (Myr) defining a third phase\n",
    "\n",
    "Erosion rates are calculated as the magnitude of each phase divided by its duration. This formulation makes it possible to simulate stepwise pulses of exhumation or burial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional details and mathematical formulations, see the [TC1D documentation](https://tc1d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/erosion-models.html#type-2-constant-rate-s-with-step-function-change-s-at-specified-time-s).\n",

    "The inversion is launched via a command-line call to the `tc1d_cli.py` script, specifying:\n",

    "1. **Misfit Plot (`mcmc_misfit.png`)**  \n",
    "   This scatter plot shows the misfit values associated with all sampled models.  \n",
    "   - The y-axis is plotted on a log scale for clarity.  \n",
    "   - The green dot marks the model with the lowest misfit.  \n",

    "2. **Chains Plot for Each Parameter (`mcmc_chains.png`)**  \n",
    "   This figure displays the evolution of sampled values for each parameter over the course of the MCMC simulation.  \n",
    "   - Each colored line corresponds to a walker.  \n",
    "   - The x-axis represents the iteration step; the y-axis shows the parameter value.  \n",
    "   - Well-mixed and overlapping chains suggest good convergence.  \n",
    "   Visual inspection helps diagnose whether the chains are stuck or have reached stationarity.\n",

    "3. **Corner Plot (`mcmc_corner.png`)**  \n",
    "   This figure shows the marginal posterior distributions and pairwise joint distributions of the inverted parameters.  \n",
    "   - The 1D histograms (top) represent the distribution of each parameter.  \n",
    "   - The 2D contour plots reveal parameter correlations.  \n",
    "   - The blue lines indicate the median values with 1σ uncertainties.  \n",
    "   This plot provides a compact summary of uncertainty and correlation in parameter estimates.\n",

    "4. **Scatter Plot of Sampled Parameter Space (`mcmc_scatter_ero_option1_vs_ero_option3.png`)**  \n",
    "   This plot shows how the MCMC sampled the parameter space of two erosion parameters (`ero_option1` and `ero_option3`).  \n",
    "   - The color scale represents misfit (darker = better fit).  \n",

    "   - The red cross marks the best-fitting model.  \n",
